Fruity Timeline
===============

An editable timeline implementation. Influenced by the oldschool
[Fruity Loops interface](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=fruity+loops+studio&tbm=isch) but you can style it however you want. Designed for a music
sequencer project I'm working on, but you could probably use it
for things like video editing etc.

[Try the demo](https://ashkyd.github.io/fruity-timeline/)

Usage
-----

This is designed to input & output in the same formats as
[mini-sequencer](https://github.com/AshKyd/mini-sequencer) so you
could potentially use it as a frontend for that (though I'm
working on the same thing right now).

For usage examples, check out [index.html](index.html).
